Change Component Description : Designator=U2 Old Description=The A5975D is a step-down monolithic power
switching regulator with a minimum switch current
limit of 3.75 A, it is therefore able to deliver up to 3
A DC current to the load depending on the
application conditions. The output voltage can be
set from 1.235 V to 35 V. The high current level is
also achieved thanks to a HSOP8 package with
exposed frame, that allows to reduce the RTHJ-A
down to approximately 40 °C/W. The device uses
an internal P-channel DMOS transistor (with a
typical RDS(on) of 250 mO) as switching element
to minimize the size of the external components.
An internal oscillator fixes the switching frequency
at 250 kHz. Having a minimum input voltage of
only 4 V, it fits automotive applications requiring
device operation even in cold crank conditions.
Pulse-by-pulse current limit with the internal
frequency modulation offers an effective constant
current short-circuit protection. New Description=The A5975D is a step-down monolithic power
